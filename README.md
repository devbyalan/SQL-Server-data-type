# SQL datatype changer
Script for SQL Server 2008~2017 to help some devs and admin to do this work

In some cases, for some reason we or other people in our team make bad choose  with data type in design time of some objects and later we need make some fix. This is a very hard work to do manually, because in some enviroments we may have  some tables, but in other inviroments we can have hundreds of objects (ie. Tables, index, views, store procedures, functions, etc) and some help perhaps these cases is its not a bad idea.

### This generate for you script for:
  - Index.
  - Check constraint.
  - Cefault constraint.
  - Check constraint.

With this information you can make a preview of workaround that you will do.
